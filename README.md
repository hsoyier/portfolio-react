## Description

- The portfolio concept is simple and user-friendly. To show my skill and experience I didn't want to distract people with many animation or vivid colors. Design should be simple and elegant and easy to read and understand. That's what came to my mind when I started thinking about design and concept about my portfolio.

- This project is made by React. React is definitely the trend technology for front end job. Why not using this it to build the showcase to show my skills and experience.

### Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- React
- Sass
- BEM
- Visual Studio Code
- Markdown
